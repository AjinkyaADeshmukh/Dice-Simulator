# Dice-Simulator

Dice Simulator is a project which shows a dice face and shuffles on clicking the shuffle button.

It is use full when you are playing and your physical die gets lost. In that case you can use a virtual dice simulator.

As the file is public any contributor is welcome to make this project a master-piece.

Finally someone said that its not how big a work makes it a great but how you do it makes it great.
